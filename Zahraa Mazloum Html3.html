                    <p>Your emotions, physical health, and level of energy can all be directly impacted by the food you eat.
                        <br> A "healthy diet" is one that has the recommended amounts of all the fundamental food categories,<br>
                         a variety of foods from each, the proper number of calories to maintain a healthy weight, and is low in fat, sugar, salt..<br>

                        You can maintain the health of your body by selecting foods that will provide you consistent energy. Additionally, it might make your mind feel fantastic. Not everyone responds well to the same diet. Speak with a health care expert to learn which foods are best for you.</p>
